Changelog
==============

#### Known issues
* Controllers probably won't be able to lock onto the arrows properly, owing to the....nontraditional menu setup here. It's likely not something I can fix, either.
* The menu may wander a bit if you resize the window or change the zoom. I'm not good at UI, this is literally two different Stardew menus forcibly hacked together. 

#### Version 1.0.0
* Initial upload.
